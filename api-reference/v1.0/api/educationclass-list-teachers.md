## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /education/classes/{educationClassId}/teachers
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the users that are a member of the group. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** and **description** properties. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Header        | Value                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
